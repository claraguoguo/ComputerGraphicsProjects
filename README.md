# Computer Graphics Projects

This repo holds projects I worked on to practice basic concepts and algorithms of computer graphics. It covers the basic methods needed to model and render 3D objects, including much of the following: graphics displays, basic optics, affine and perspective transformations, windows and viewports, visibility, illumination and reflectance models, parametric representations, curves and surfaces, texture mapping, graphics hardware, ray tracing, graphics toolkits, animation systems.

## Topics:
* Raster Images
* Ray Casting
* Ray Tracing
* Bounding Volume Hierarchy
* Meshes
* Kinematics
* Mass-Spring Systems
